1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Ans. - It makes the task of finding only the difference between two files very simple and time efficient.
With it I only need to check where the changes are done and then I can correct it easily !!!


2) How could having easy access to the entire history of file make you a more efficient programmer
in the long term??

It will really help a lot because pogrammers always makes mistakes. And with the easy access I don't have
to worry about the mistakes which I have made :P


3) What do you think are the pro and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do
in Git, vs having versions automatically saved like Google docss does?

Pros-
i) Only meaningful versions will be saved.
ii) Will have less cluttered history.

Cons-
i) Commits depend on the programmer.
ii) Maybe we forget about comits when coding/working on a file.


4) Why do you think some Version Control systems,like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
 while others, like Google Docs, treat each files separately?

 Because they are not for programming files !!


5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files ?

i) Download the repository by:
 git clone http://.........................

ii) Type cd version-control/reflections/file_name
iii) Type git log
Then find out the required files by checking their messages as README

iv) Then Copy the ids between which you want to differentiate by
git diff first_id second_id

v) Press q to quit


6) How to run a specific version of the file which I have created?

It's easy :
i) Type git checkout <your required id>
ii) Run it from version control!


7)How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It is like a superpower with which I can play with my code and add new features without being in the fear 
breaking the original file.
