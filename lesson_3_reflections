1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Ans. It helps because :
i) It enables other users to add some features.
ii) It can be accessed on any computer.
iii) It act as a backup, in case the local repository gets deleted accidently.


2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

Because:
i) It will cause more data charges.
ii) It will mess up everything.


3) Describe the difference between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Ans. Forks - When I want to copy any user's repository on my profile on Github
     Branches - Experimental codes written wrt to main project
     Clones - Copy of repository on the local computer

	 
4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally ?

Ans. It helps in case there is conflict between two commits and it also helps in keepin the local
repository up to date with the remote.


5) How would you collaborate without uing Git and GitHub ? What would be easier, and what would be harder ?

Ans. The only way to collaborate without it is through collaborating offline on our local computers
and changing and extending the code.
It would be harder, and very ineffiecient.... Thanks to Git and GitHub :)

4) When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master ?
What benefits does each approach have?

Ans. When I am unsure about the feature then I would like to work in a separate branch and test it.
And after my testing I can happily merge that branch in master to update it.
Both have their own benefits like, a separate branch allows to add features without breaking the already
working main project.
while main project is just pretty straight forward like, do and done !!
