1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Ans. It helps because :
i) It enables other users to add some features.
ii) It can be accessed on any computer.
iii) It act as a backup, in case the local repository gets deleted accidently.


2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

Because:
i) It will cause more data charges.
ii) It will mess up everything.


3) Describe the difference between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Ans. Forks - When I want to copy any user's repository on my profile on Github
     Branches - Experimental codes written wrt to main project
     Clones - Copy of repository on the local computer


4) When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master ?
What benefits does each approach have?

Ans. When I am unsure about the feature then I would like to work in a separate branch and test it.
And after my testing I can happily merge that branch in master to update it.
Both have their own benefits like, a separate branch allows to add features without breaking the already
working main project.
while main project is just pretty straight forward like, do and done !!
