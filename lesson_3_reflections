1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Ans. It helps because :
i) It enables other users to add some features.
ii) It can be accessed on any computer.
iii) It act as a backup, in case the local repository gets deleted accidently.


2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

Because:
i) It will cause more data charges.
ii) It will mess up everything.


3) Describe the difference between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Ans. Forks - When I want to copy any user's repository on my profile on Github
     Branches - Experimental codes written wrt to main project
     Clones - Copy of repository on the local computer

	 
4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally ?

Ans. It helps in case there is conflict between two commits and it also helps in keepin the local
repository up to date with the remote.
